# ðŸš€ Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet - 450 DSA Questions

This repository contains my daily solutions to the **450 DSA questions from Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet**.  
The goal is to practice consistently, strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.  

## ðŸ“Œ About
- âœ… Covers all important DSA topics: Arrays, Strings, Recursion, DP, Graphs, Trees, Tries, Greedy, and more.  
- âœ… Each problem includes **solution code + explanation**.  
- âœ… Practicing daily to build **speed, accuracy, and confidence** for technical interviews.  

## ðŸ’¡ Languages Used
- **Java** (primary)  
- Occasionally: C++  for cross-checking approaches  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Master all 450 questions  
- Maintain daily consistency  
- Become interview-ready for top tech companies
