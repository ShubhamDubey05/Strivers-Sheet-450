# 📘 What is Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is defined as:  
- A **finite set of steps** to solve any problem.  
- Or, more formally: *An algorithm is a finite, ordered sequence of well-defined instructions that take some input, process it step by step, and produce an output.*

## ✨ Key Features of an Algorithm

1. **Finiteness** → It must end after a limited number of steps.  

2. **Definiteness** → Each step must be clear and **unambiguous**.  
   - **Ambiguous instruction**: "Cook the food properly." ❌  
   - **Unambiguous instruction**: "Boil water at 100°C for 10 minutes." ✅  

3. **Input** → It may take **zero or more inputs**.  

4. **Output** → It must produce at least **one output (result)**.  

5. **Effectiveness** → Each step must be simple enough to be carried out easily.

# 🔹 Complexity of Algorithms

The **complexity** of an algorithm measures its **efficiency** in terms of:  
- **Time Complexity** → How fast it runs.  
- **Space Complexity** → How much memory it uses.

## ⏳ Time Complexity

Time complexity = Number of **basic operations** executed as a function of input size **n**.  

### Common Time Complexities:
- **O(1)** → Constant  
- **O(log n)** → Logarithmic  
- **O(n)** → Linear  
- **O(n log n)** → Linearithmic  
- **O(n²)** → Quadratic  
- **O(2^n)** → Exponential  
- **O(n!)** → Factorial  

✅ Helps to compare algorithms and choose the best.

## 💾 Space Complexity

Space used by an algorithm includes:  
- **Fixed part** → Constant memory (code, variables).  
- **Variable part** → Memory depends on input size, recursion stack, temporary data.
